# Workflow of QEC Code

In this section, we describe the full process of a QEC code, from encoding logical information to applying correction operators. We also introduce key concepts required at each step.

Quantum Error Correction generally operates in the following sequence:

---

## 1. Encoding

Encoding distributes and stores logical information across multiple physical qubits.

There are several quantum error-correcting codes capable of storing logical information. The choice of code determines important trade-offs, including:

- Physical-qubit overhead  
- Achievable code distance  
- Stabilizer weight  
- Decoding complexity  
- Availability of fault-tolerant logical gates  

Different codes therefore have different advantages and limitations.

## 2. Syndrome Extraction

Syndrome extraction repeatedly measures stabilizers using ancilla (measurement) qubits so that:

- Data qubits are not directly measured  
- Encoded logical information is preserved  

A **syndrome** is the collection of classical measurement outcomes (±1 or 0/1 bits) indicating whether each stabilizer/parity-check is satisfied. It reveals the presence and approximate location of errors without revealing the logical state itself.

In practice, each stabilizer measurement follows a parity-check principle:

- The ancilla is prepared in a known state  
  - \(|0\rangle\) for Z-type parity  
  - \(|+\rangle\) for X-type parity  

- The ancilla is entangled with specific data qubits using controlled gates (e.g., CNOTs).

- The ancilla accumulates the parity information.

- The ancilla is measured to produce a syndrome bit.

For example:

- For a Z-type check, CNOTs from data qubits (control) to ancilla (target) map the Z-parity onto the ancilla measurement.

- For an X-type check, the same idea is applied in the X basis (often using Hadamard gates before and after CNOTs).

Repeating stabilizer measurements over multiple cycles allows the decoder to track changes in syndrome bits over time and distinguish data errors from measurement noise.

## 3. Decoding

Decoding infers the most likely set of errors from the observed syndromes.

Using the parity-check structure of the code, syndrome patterns are mapped to candidate error configurations. The decoder selects the configuration that is most probable under an assumed noise model.

Common decoding algorithms include:

### MWPM (Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching)

MWPM treats detection events (changes in syndrome bits across space–time) as nodes in a graph.

- Nodes are connected with weighted edges representing likely error chains.
- The algorithm finds the minimum-total-weight matching.
- This predicts the most likely error paths and their locations.

---

### Union-Find (UF) Decoder

The Union-Find decoder uses a clustering approach:

- Clusters grow around syndrome defects.
- Clusters merge until defects are neutralized.
- It approximates MWPM logic but runs in near-linear time.

---

### Belief Propagation (BP)

BP operates on the Tanner graph of the parity-check matrix.

- Messages are passed between variable nodes (qubits) and check nodes (stabilizers).
- Marginal probabilities for error types are estimated.
- The most likely per-qubit error pattern is selected.

---

### Neural-Network (NN) Decoders

Neural-network decoders learn the syndrome-to-correction mapping from data.

Given training samples of (syndrome, true error) pairs, the trained model outputs:

- A correction operator, or  
- Per-qubit error probabilities  

They can capture correlated noise effects such as:

- Biased noise  
- Crosstalk  
- Measurement faults  

---

## 4. Correction

Once the decoder infers the most likely error configuration, a correction operator is applied.

This operator reverses the inferred errors and restores the logical state.
