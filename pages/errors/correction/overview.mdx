# Quantum Error Correction

Quantum error correction is a technique that preserves the logical outcome of a computation even when errors occur.

The core idea is to redundantly encode a single logical qubit into multiple physical qubits. While the computation proceeds, the system periodically measures **syndromes** that indicate traces of errors to infer what error occurred. Then it applies the corresponding correction operator to cancel the error’s impact.

In the upcoming **FTQC era**, meaningful algorithms require very deep circuits and many operations. With NISQ-level error rates, errors accumulate and can easily cause the computation to fail, making quantum error correction essential.
