# Zero-Noise Extrapolation

Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) is a quantum error mitigation technique in which the same circuit is executed multiple times with **artificially amplified noise**. After observing how the result changes as a function of noise strength, the trend is used to extrapolate to the value at **zero noise**.

ZNE consists of two main stages:

1. **Noise amplification**  
   The original quantum circuit is executed multiple times at different effective noise rates.

2. **Extrapolation**  
   The ideal result is estimated by extrapolating the noisy expectation values to the zero-noise limit.

## Noise Amplification via Digital Gate Folding

Both the noise amplification and extrapolation stages can be implemented in different ways. A common method for noise amplification is **digital gate folding**.

Digital gate folding increases circuit depth while preserving the logical computation by inserting gate–inverse pairs.

### Basic principle

For a unitary gate **U**, we use the identity:

U · U<sup>†</sup> = I

Therefore, we can replace:

U → U · U<sup>†</sup> · U

This transformation:

- Preserves the logical operation
- Increases circuit depth
- Amplifies the accumulated noise

## Global vs Local Gate Folding

Two common folding strategies are used:

### 1. Global Gate Folding

The entire circuit C is treated as a single unitary:

C → C · C<sup>†</sup> · C

This amplifies noise uniformly across the full circuit.

---

### 2. Local Gate Folding

Each individual gate is folded separately.

If the original circuit contains:

U₁, U₂, U₃

After local folding, it becomes:

U₁U₁<sup>†</sup>U₁  
U₂U₂<sup>†</sup>U₂  
U₃U₃<sup>†</sup>U₃  

Local folding allows finer control over how noise is amplified.

## Why ZNE Works

If the noisy expectation value can be modeled as a smooth function of noise scale λ:

E(λ)

Then by evaluating E(λ) at multiple noise levels (for example λ = 1, 2, 3), we can extrapolate to:

E(0)

which approximates the ideal noise-free expectation value.

## Summary

Zero-Noise Extrapolation:

- Does not require additional qubits  
- Works within NISQ hardware constraints  
- Trades increased circuit executions and post-processing cost for improved accuracy  

It is therefore one of the most practical error mitigation techniques for near-term quantum devices.
