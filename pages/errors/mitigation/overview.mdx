# Quantum Error Mitigation

Quantum error mitigation, as its name suggests, is a method for obtaining more plausible results by correcting expectation values (recovering estimates) from execution outcomes contaminated by errors, or by statistically removing error components.

Unlike quantum error correction, which constructs codes using additional qubits to detect and correct errors, error mitigation aims to achieve a practically attainable level of accuracy improvement under the constraints of current **NISQ hardware** (short coherence times, high gate and measurement error rates, and limited numbers of qubits).

Most error mitigation techniques have the following characteristics:

- They require little to no additional physical qubits (or only very limited extra qubits).
- Instead, they increase the number of shots, the number of circuit executions, and the cost of post-processing.
- To improve mitigation results, the noise model should not vary significantly, or the calibration required for correction must be reliable.
