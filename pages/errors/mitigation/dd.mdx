# Dynamical Decoupling (DD)

Dynamical decoupling mitigates decoherence by inserting carefully designed pulse sequences during idle periods. This helps slow noise contributions average out over time, reducing error accumulation **without** directly measuring or correcting the quantum state.

## Stages of DD

DD consists of two stages:

1. **Idle-window identification and pulse insertion**  
   The circuit is analyzed to find idle intervals on qubits, and a DD sequence (e.g., CPMG, XY4, LDD, …) is inserted into those windows while preserving the intended logical computation.

2. **Noise averaging via refocusing**  
   The inserted π-pulse pattern repeatedly flips the qubit state so that low-frequency phase noise and unwanted system–environment interactions acquire alternating signs and largely cancel in the time average. This yields improved coherence and more reliable expectation values.
