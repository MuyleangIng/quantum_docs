# Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC)

After modeling the noise channel (how errors are introduced), the circuit is modified so that the noise can be statistically canceled. The modified circuits are executed repeatedly and averaged to estimate the ideal (noise-free) expectation value.

## Stages of PEC

PEC consists of four stages:

1. **Noise characterization**  
   Experimentally estimate the noise associated with each gate/channel.

2. **Quasi-probability decomposition configuration**  
   Approximate an ideal gate as a linear combination of noisy gates.

3. **Random sampling**  
   For each run, sample a circuit modification according to the decomposition and execute it.

4. **Recovering expectation value**  
   Multiply each run’s outcome by the corresponding weight and average to obtain a mitigated expectation value.
