# Quantum Error Mitigation

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) aims to obtain **more reliable results** from noisy quantum hardware by correcting expectation values or statistically reducing error components.

Unlike **quantum error correction**, mitigation techniques typically:

- require **little to no extra physical qubits**
- trade hardware overhead for **more shots / more circuit executions**
- rely on **calibration** and relatively stable noise behavior
