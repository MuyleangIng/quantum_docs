# Quantum Error Correction

Quantum error correction (QEC) is a method for preserving the **logical outcome** of a computation even when physical errors occur.

The key idea is to:

- encode **one logical qubit** into **many physical qubits**
- measure **syndromes** (error information) using ancillas without destroying the logical state
- use a **decoder** to infer the most likely error pattern
- apply a **correction** that cancels the error’s effect

QEC is essential for **fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC)**, where deep circuits would otherwise fail due to accumulated noise.
