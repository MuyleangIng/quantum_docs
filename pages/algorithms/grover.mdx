# Grover’s Algorithm

## Content Summary

Grover’s algorithm searches an unstructured list faster than any classical algorithm in the black-box model, achieving a **quadratic speedup**.

## The “What” & “Why”

### What it is
- A probability amplification method that increases the chance of measuring the **marked** solution state

### Why we use it
- Quadratic speedup: $O(\sqrt{N})$ oracle queries instead of $O(N)$

## Study Case: The “Winning Ticket”

You have 4 hidden cards: $\{00, 01, 10, 11\}$. Only one is the winner (say `11`).

- Classical: average ~2 tries
- Grover: 1 iteration can make the winner appear with very high probability (for $N=4$, it becomes essentially perfect)

## Algorithm Flow (Student Understanding)

1. Put all states into superposition
2. Oracle marks the winner by flipping its phase
3. Diffuser amplifies the marked state amplitude
4. Measure (you should get the winner)

## Practical Testing (Qiskit Code): Find $|11\rangle$ in 2 qubits

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorSampler

def get_counts(pub_result):
    data = pub_result.data
    if isinstance(data, dict) and "meas" in data:
        return data["meas"].get_counts()
    if hasattr(data, "meas"):
        return data.meas.get_counts()
    return {"ERROR": "No 'meas' found in result.data"}

qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# 1) Superposition
qc.h([0, 1])

# 2) Oracle: mark |11> (phase flip on |11>)
qc.cz(0, 1)

# 3) Diffuser (standard 2-qubit diffuser)
qc.h([0, 1])
qc.x([0, 1])
qc.h(1)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.h(1)
qc.x([0, 1])
qc.h([0, 1])

# 4) Measure
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

sampler = StatevectorSampler()
job = sampler.run([qc], shots=1024)
pub_result = job.result()[0]
print("Search Results:", get_counts(pub_result))

Result Explanation

Expected: counts concentrated on:

11

Interpretation:

Grover amplified the probability of the winning state without checking each state one-by-one.

Student Practice

Change the winner from 11 to 10:

Apply X to the qubit you want to flip before the oracle

Apply CZ

Undo the X after CZ

Run and confirm the output shifts toward 10

Remove the diffuser:

Keep only superposition + oracle

Compare the distribution (winner will not dominate strongly)
