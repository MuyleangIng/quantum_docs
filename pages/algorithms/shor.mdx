# Shor’s Algorithm (Concept Focus)

## 1. Content Summary

Shor’s algorithm factors large integers **exponentially faster** than the best-known classical algorithms by reducing factoring to a **period-finding problem**.  

This has major implications for cryptography, particularly RSA encryption.

---

## 2. The “What” & “Why”

### What It Is

Shor’s algorithm is a factoring algorithm built on:

- **Quantum period finding**
- The **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**

It combines quantum computation (for finding periods) with classical post-processing (for extracting factors).

---

### Why We Use It

- Demonstrates **exponential quantum speedup**
- Shows that large-scale quantum computers could break RSA
- Motivates global research into quantum-safe cryptography

## 3. Core Mathematical Idea

Factoring an integer \( N \) can be reduced to finding the **period** \( r \) of the function:

$$
f(x) = a^x \bmod N
$$

If we find \( r \) such that:

$$
a^r \equiv 1 \pmod{N}
$$

then we can compute factors using:

$$
\gcd(a^{r/2} - 1, N)
$$
and
$$
\gcd(a^{r/2} + 1, N)
$$

---

## 4. Study Case: Period Finding for N = 15

Let:

- \( N = 15 \)
- Choose \( a = 7 \)

Compute the sequence:

- \( 7^1 \bmod 15 = 7 \)
- \( 7^2 \bmod 15 = 4 \)
- \( 7^3 \bmod 15 = 13 \)
- \( 7^4 \bmod 15 = 1 \)

The sequence repeats every:

$$
r = 4
$$

Now compute:

$$
\gcd(7^{2} - 1, 15) = \gcd(48, 15) = 3
$$

$$
\gcd(7^{2} + 1, 15) = \gcd(50, 15) = 5
$$

So the factors are:

$$
3 \text{ and } 5
$$

Shor’s quantum part efficiently finds the period \( r \).

## 5. How Shor’s Algorithm Works (High-Level Flow)

1. Choose random \( a < N \)
2. Build quantum circuit to evaluate \( f(x) = a^x \bmod N \)
3. Apply **Quantum Fourier Transform**
4. Measure to extract information about the period \( r \)
5. Use classical mathematics to compute factors

The quantum computer’s job is to find the **period**.

---

## 6. Role of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

The QFT transforms a quantum state from the computational basis into a **frequency representation**.

Mathematically:

$$
|x\rangle \rightarrow 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} 
\sum_{y=0}^{2^n - 1} 
e^{2\pi i x y / 2^n} 
|y\rangle
$$

This transformation allows the circuit to detect periodic structure in the function.

## 7. Practical Testing (Simplified QFT Circuit)

Full Shor’s algorithm is large and hardware-intensive.  
Below is a simplified QFT-style pattern illustrating the “engine”.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
import numpy as np

qc = QuantumCircuit(3)

# QFT-style pattern (simplified illustration)
qc.h(2)
qc.cp(np.pi/2, 1, 2)
qc.cp(np.pi/4, 0, 2)

qc.h(1)
qc.cp(np.pi/2, 0, 1)

qc.h(0)

print(qc.draw())
