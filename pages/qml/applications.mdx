# Applications of QML

### Content

- Image Classification  

---

QML has been explored in classification, regression, clustering, and optimization. Most practical applications adopt **hybrid architectures**, where classical systems handle feature extraction and quantum circuits act as intermediate transformation modules.

## Image Classification

In a hybrid image classification pipeline:

1. Classical CNN extracts and compresses image features  
2. Features are encoded into quantum states  
3. A PQC transforms the encoded representation  
4. Measurement returns values to classical layers  
5. Classical layers output the final prediction  
6. Training updates both classical and quantum parameters

This demonstrates how QML integrates quantum modules into realistic learning systems under NISQ constraints.
