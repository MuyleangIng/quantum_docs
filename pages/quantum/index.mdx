# Quantum Basic

## Outlines

| **Part** | **Section** | **Title** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **1.1** | **Introduction to Quantum Computing** | To explain the motivation for quantum computing, highlight the limitations of classical computers, and provide the big-picture context for why quantum mechanics is used for computation. |
|  | **1.2** | **Qubit** | To define the basic unit of quantum information and introduce how quantum information differs from classical bits using intuitive notation. |
|  | **1.3** | **Superposition** | To explain how a qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously and introduce probabilistic behavior without heavy mathematics. |
|  | **1.4** | **Entanglement** | To introduce the concept of correlated quantum states and explain why entanglement has no classical equivalent. |
|  | **1.5** | **Quantum Measurement** | To explain how quantum states are converted into classical results and introduce wave-function collapse, probabilities, and normalization. |
| **2** | **2.1** | **The Basics of the Quantum Circuit** | To teach readers how to read quantum circuits by understanding qubit wires, time flow, operations, and measurement—without explaining gate mechanics yet. |
|  | **2.2** | **Main Elements of a Quantum Circuit** | To provide a high-level structural overview of quantum circuits (state preparation, operations, measurement) before examining diagrams in detail. |
| **3** | **3.1** | **Introduction to Quantum Gates** | To define what quantum gates are, how they appear in circuits, and how they differ from classical logic gates. |
|  | **3.2** | **Single-Qubit Gates (X, H, Z)** | To explain how individual qubits are manipulated, including flipping states, creating superposition, and changing phase, using intuition, visuals, and simple examples. |
|  | **3.3** | **Multi-Qubit Gates (CNOT, SWAP)** | To demonstrate how qubits interact with each other, introduce control–target relationships, and explain how entanglement is created. |
|  | **3.4** | **Phase and Rotation Gates** | To introduce fine-grained control of qubit states using phase and rotation, and explain why these gates are essential for advanced quantum algorithms. |
| **4 (Optional)** | **4.1** | **Putting It All Together: Simple Quantum Circuits** | To combine circuits and gates into complete examples (e.g., Bell state), helping learners predict outcomes and connect intuition with circuit behavior. |
