# Fundamentals of Quantum Computing

## Introduction to Quantum Computing

The development of quantum computing began in the early twentieth century with the emergence of quantum physics. Today, it has become a major area of research and technological competition, as quantum computing is widely regarded as a next-generation technology aimed at overcoming some of the limitations of classical computers. In October 2019, a research team at Google announced that a quantum computer had solved a problem in just a few minutes—one that would have taken a classical supercomputer thousands of years to complete. Although the task itself had limited practical relevance, this result highlighted the fundamentally different way quantum computers process information.

The key distinction lies in how information is represented and manipulated. Classical computers use bits that can exist only in the states 0 or 1, whereas quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in superpositions of states and become entangled with one another. By exploiting **superposition**, **entanglement**, and **quantum interference**, quantum computers can explore computational spaces in ways that are not accessible to classical systems.

## What Is a Qubit?

A **qubit**, or **quantum bit**, is the basic unit of information used in quantum computers. Like a classical bit, a qubit can represent two values: **0** or **1**. However, in quantum computing, these values are written using **bra–ket notation** (also called **Dirac notation**). The two basic qubit states are written as $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.

The key difference is **superposition**. While a classical bit must be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a state that represents both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ simultaneously.

## Superposition

As mentioned in the previous section, a qubit has the unique ability to represent both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ at the same time. This phenomenon is known as **superposition**.

A common way to visualize superposition is to imagine a spinning coin. While the coin is spinning, it is not strictly "heads" or "tails," but rather a blur of both states. However, the moment you stop the coin—or **measure** the qubit—the superposition **collapses** into a single valid quantum state.

In practice, we use the **Bloch sphere** to visualize this behavior. The sphere provides a geometric way to see how a qubit’s state changes. While the North and South poles represent the basic $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ states, any point on the surface of the sphere between those poles represents a qubit in a state of superposition.

## Entanglement

While **superposition** describes the behavior of a single qubit, **entanglement** is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more qubits become deeply linked. Once entangled, the state of these qubits cannot be described independently, no matter how far apart they are.

In simpler terms, when qubits are entangled, they share a unified state. This means that the result of measuring one qubit is strongly correlated with the result of measuring the other. For example, if one qubit is measured and collapses into the $|0\rangle$ state, you can immediately infer the corresponding outcome of the other qubit (depending on how the entangled state was prepared).

Entanglement has no classical equivalent and is one of the key resources that gives quantum computers their power. It is foundational for several advanced quantum protocols, including:

- **Quantum teleportation:** transferring the state of a qubit from one location to another without physically moving the qubit itself.
- **Quantum error correction:** protecting fragile quantum information by encoding it across multiple entangled qubits.

## Quantum Measurement

Quantum measurement is the final and most critical step in a quantum algorithm. It is the process of observing a qubit to extract information, acting as the bridge that translates quantum possibilities into classical data.

In classical computing, a bit has a definite value (0 or 1). In contrast, a qubit can exist in a superposition. When a qubit is measured, it collapses into one of the classical states $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$.

### Wave Function Collapse

Measurement is not a passive process. When you measure a qubit, you force it to choose a definite outcome. This is known as the **collapse of the wave function**. The qubit transitions from a superposition of states into a single classical state, either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$.

### Probability and Amplitudes

Because of superposition, we cannot predict with absolute certainty which state a qubit will collapse into. Instead, we use **probability amplitudes**, represented by the complex numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

The state of a qubit is written as:

$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
$$

- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are probability amplitudes.
- $|\alpha|^2$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in state $|0\rangle$.
- $|\beta|^2$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in state $|1\rangle$.

### The Normalization Rule

The sum of the probabilities must always equal 1:

$$
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
$$

For example, if a qubit has a 50% chance of being 0 $(|\alpha|^2 = 0.5)$, then it must have a 50% chance of being 1 $(|\beta|^2 = 0.5)$.

### The Vector Representation (Math of Qubits)

Before we move on to manipulating qubits with gates, it helps to know how we write these states as **vectors** (lists of numbers). This is the language used to compute how gates affect qubits.

{/*
The state $|0\rangle$ is written as the vector $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
The state $|1\rangle$ is written as the vector $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
