# Quantum Gates

## Quantum Gates

In the previous section, we learned how to **read a quantum circuit**, how qubits are represented as wires and where measurements occur. We also saw that symbols placed on qubit wires represent **operations**. These operations are called **quantum gates**.

Quantum gates are the fundamental building blocks of quantum circuits. They define **how qubits are manipulated** during a quantum computation.

## What Is a Quantum Gate?

A **quantum gate** is an operation that changes the state of a qubit (or multiple qubits). In a circuit diagram, a quantum gate is shown as a symbol placed on a qubit wire.

- Quantum gates **act on qubits**
- They modify how a qubit behaves over time
- They are applied in a specific order as the circuit progresses

For now, it is enough to think of a quantum gate as a **rule that transforms a qubit’s state**.

## Quantum Gates vs Classical Logic Gates

In classical computing, logic gates (such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`) operate on bits that are always either 0 or 1. Quantum gates, however, operate on **qubits**, which may exist in superposition.

## Single-Qubit and Multi-Qubit Gates

Quantum gates can act on different numbers of qubits.

## Single-Qubit Gates (X, H, Z)

These gates act on one qubit line. We will assume our qubit always starts in the state $|0⟩$.

These gates are used to:

- Flip a qubit’s state
- Create superposition
- Change the phase of a qubit

> **Image placeholder:** Apply X gate

> **Image placeholder:** Bloch sphere for $|1⟩$

### X Gate (Quantum NOT)

When we apply the **X gate** (quantum NOT gate), it flips the state of a qubit:

- If the qubit is in state $|0⟩$, X changes it to $|1⟩$
- If the qubit is in state $|1⟩$, X changes it to $|0⟩$

This behavior is similar to the NOT operation in classical computing.

### H Gate (Hadamard)

The **H (Hadamard) gate** is used to create **superposition**. When applied to a qubit:

- A qubit starting in $|0⟩$ becomes an equal combination of $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$
- This means the qubit has a probability of being measured as either state

The Hadamard gate is essential in many quantum algorithms because it allows quantum computers to explore multiple possibilities at the same time.

### Z Gate (Phase Flip)

The **Z gate** does not change whether a qubit is $|0⟩$ or $|1⟩$ when measured. Instead, it changes the **phase** of the $|1⟩$ state.

Phase changes are not directly observable through measurement, but they play a crucial role in quantum interference and algorithm performance.

Together, X, H, and Z gates allow us to flip states, create superpositions, and control phase, forming the foundation of single-qubit operations.

## Multi-Qubit Gates (CNOT, SWAP) (draft)

Multi-qubit gates act on **two or more qubits at the same time** and allow qubits to interact with each other. These interactions are what make **entanglement** possible.

### CNOT (Controlled-NOT)

The **CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate** involves two qubits:

- a **control qubit**
- a **target qubit**

The rule is simple:

- If the control qubit is $|1⟩$, the target qubit is flipped
- If the control qubit is $|0⟩$, the target qubit remains unchanged

When the control qubit is in a superposition, the CNOT gate can create **entangled states**, where the states of the two qubits become correlated.

### SWAP

The **SWAP gate** exchanges the states of two qubits:

- The state of the first qubit is swapped with the state of the second qubit

The SWAP gate is useful when qubits are physically separated on hardware and need to exchange information within a quantum circuit.

Multi-qubit gates are essential for building meaningful quantum circuits, as they enable information sharing and entanglement between qubits.

## Phase and Rotation Gates (draft)

Phase and rotation gates provide **fine-grained control** over a qubit’s state. Instead of simply flipping or creating superposition, these gates rotate the qubit by a specific angle.

Rotation gates adjust the qubit’s state around different axes of the Bloch sphere using a chosen angle $\theta$. This allows precise control over:

- the probability of measurement outcomes
- the phase relationships between quantum states

Phase gates modify the phase of a qubit without changing its measurement probabilities directly. These phase adjustments are crucial for controlling interference effects in quantum algorithms.

Such gates are especially important in advanced algorithms like **Shor’s algorithm** and **Grover’s algorithm**, where small phase differences determine whether the final result is amplified or canceled out.

In practice, phase and rotation gates allow quantum circuits to be tuned with high precision, enabling complex quantum computations that go beyond basic gate operations.
